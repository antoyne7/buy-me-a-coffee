# Buy Me A Coffee

Buy Me A Coffee is a small project I made to introduce myself into cryptocurrency and blockchain stuff.

This is a very simple website with only one page.
I didn't use dependencies like web3js or ethers, only Metamask api to make simple actions like
- get wallet address
- change network
- add a network
- request transaction
